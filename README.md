**Securely share QR data across devices with timeboxed encryption**

</div>

## ‚ú® Overview 

QR Sync lets you scan a QR code on one device and access its content securely on any other device, anywhere, anytime. Your data stays encrypted in the cloud for just 5 minutes before being permanently deleted - balancing convenience with security.

> Just a boring day and a good project. :)

## üöÄ Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any device with a web browser
- **End-to-End Encryption**: PIN + Character authentication for secure access
- **Auto-Deletion**: Data automatically removed after 5 minutes
- **Mobile Optimized**: Clean, responsive interface on all screen sizes
- **Easy Sharing**: Simple workflow for accessing data across devices

## üì± How It Works

### Step 1: Scan a QR Code
Open the app on your mobile device, click "Start Scanning", and grant camera permissions. Scan any QR code to capture its data.

### Step 2: Enable QR Sync
After scanning, tap "Enable QR Sync" to prepare your data for cross-device access.

### Step 3: Create Security Credentials
Set a 4-digit PIN and select two letters to create your secure access key. This combination is used for encryption and hashing.

### Step 5: Enter Your Credentials
Enter the same 4-digit PIN and two characters you selected earlier, then click "Access Data".
